# Recipe Parser
A python package for scraping recipes from cooking websites and parsing the output.

## Recipe Parser
This parser is based on [recipe-scrapers](https://github.com/hhursev/recipe-scrapers) by [hhursev](https://github.com/hhursev). While the package is very useful, it lacks some of the tools I needed to parse recipes so I decided to write my own using the same principles. I likely could have just used the API, but I was interested in exploring how to parse pages based on `schema.org`

### Recipe Schema
